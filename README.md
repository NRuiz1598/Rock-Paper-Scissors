# Rock Paper Scissors Project

## Objective

- Create a simple Rock Paper Scissors game with the knowladge acquired so far.


### What am I expecting to learn or improve in this project? 

- I want to understand better how functions work. ⏳
- Improve at loops and conditionals if I use them. ✅
- Improve at problem solving and debugging. ⏳
- Try not to make redundant code. ❌


### What I learned?

- Im feeling more confident using functions, but Im still confused on when I should return some values and when I should not. 

- I think Im getting better at loops and coditionals, but there is still room to improve. 

- I need to start using things like debugger and breakpoints to improve my debugging skills even more, although I always tried to paid attention to what the console say when an error popped even as a complete beginner.

- My code is super messy and repetitive, I hope to get better at this with more experience and practice.
